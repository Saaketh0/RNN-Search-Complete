# RNN-Search-Complete
RNN training off "War and Peace" to predict words in advance.


This was done in my artificial intelligence class, building off a previous autocomplete function and neural network we built previously.

Moved everything here to primarily show the code, instead of the assignment description and todos.

Run the rnn_complete.py file, and it will ask you for a word, the amount of chars you want to generate and the temperature (randomness)
